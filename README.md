## 🤝 Acknowledgments
This project is a deep refactoring and feature extension based on the excellent concept of [unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp).

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🛠️ **805 REST Skills Toolkit**: 56 source files across 54 categories, plus 28 advisory design modules, with Batch operations.
- ⚡ **UnityCLI Support**: Bind UnityCLI to cold-start the bound project — no need to launch Unity Hub.
- 🔐 **Three-Tier Permission Modes**: Approval / Auto / Bypass with dual approval channels, aligned with Claude Code permission modes.
- 🤖 **6 Major IDEs Native Support**: Claude Code / Antigravity / Codex / Cursor / OpenCode / Kimi Code — one-click install and use.
- 🛡️ **Transactional Atomicity**: Failed operations auto-rollback, leaving scenes clean.
- 🌍 **Multi-Instance Control**: Automatic port discovery and global registry for controlling multiple Unity projects at once.
- 🔗 **Stable Long Connections**: Configurable request timeout (default 15 minutes), automatic recovery after Domain Reload.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Hallucination Guardrails**: Each Skill module includes DO NOT lists and routing rules.

## 🛡️ Built for Trust: The Governance Layer

An AI driving the Editor writes to real scenes, prefabs and `.meta` files. The interesting question isn't whether it *can* — it's what happens when it gets something wrong. UnitySkills answers that at four points in the call lifecycle:

- **Before execution**: `?mode=dryRun` / `?mode=plan` rehearsal — returns parameter validation and an impact estimate, writes nothing.
- **At execution**: the server derives high-risk gating (NeverInSemi) from each skill's risk metadata — gating never depends on the AI behaving well; **Allowlist** grants a persistent per-skill pass.
- **After execution**: every call, grant, revoke and blocked hit lands in a JSONL audit trail, browsable in the panel; deletions are audited too.
- **After a mistake**: five types of persistent snapshots survive Domain Reloads; `workflow_undo_task` rolls back one task, not the whole project; `POST /skills/batch` runs as a transaction (cross-step `$ref`, rollback on failure, `?diff=1` net change).

Full mechanics → [Operating Modes & Governance](docs/OPERATING_MODES.md)

### How this compares

| Dimension | UnitySkills | Typical MCP bridge | Unity's official AI Assistant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Permission granularity** | Per-operation: three modes (Approval / Auto / Bypass) + risk metadata on every skill + per-skill Allowlist | No permission model — once connected, the whole tool surface is callable | Per-client trust (Pending Connections → Allow / Revoke); after approval, calls are not distinguished by operation |
| **Audit** | Structured JSONL for every call / grant / revoke / block, browsable in-panel; deletions are audited too | Process logs only; no structured per-call record | Surfaced as chat history and checkpoints rather than a per-operation audit record |
| **Rollback granularity** | Per-task, five snapshot types, file and `.meta` content-addressed, persists across sessions | Relies on Unity's native Undo stack; not guaranteed to survive a Domain Reload | Project-wide checkpoints taken per prompt — restoring rewinds the entire project to that point |
| **Pre-execution preview** | `?mode=dryRun` / `?mode=plan` — semantic parameter validation + impact estimate, nothing written | No equivalent found | No pre-execution parameter validation or impact preview found |
| **Batch transactions** | `POST /skills/batch` — fail-fast / `continueOnError`, cross-step `$ref`, rollback, `?diff=1` net change | Per-call tool invocations, no transaction semantics | Not exposed as a batch transaction |

> The **UnitySkills** column describes mechanisms that exist in this repository and can be checked against the source or by calling the endpoints. The other two columns reflect **public material and open-source repositories surveyed in 2026-07**; they characterise a class of tooling rather than any specific project, and those capabilities may have changed since.

## 🔐 Operating Modes

UnitySkills ships with a true server-side permission system aligned with Claude Code permission modes. All mode switching happens in the Unity panel: **Window > UnitySkills** → ⚙ Settings → **Server** section (chat trigger words are no longer supported).

| Mode | Default | Behavior |
|:-----|:-------:|:---------|
| **Approval** | — | Server returns a grant token; the AI executes after user approval |
| **Auto** | New installs | FullAuto skills run directly; high-risk ops (NeverInSemi) are auto-blocked |
| **Bypass** | Existing installs (upgrade) | All skills run unrestricted; only the optional high-risk confirmation gate remains |

Upgrading users are detected automatically and stay on **Bypass**, preserving the previous Full-Auto behavior with no action required. Dual approval channels (Dialog / Panel), the audit log (`Library/UnitySkillsAudit.jsonl`), Allowlist and installer details → [Operating Modes & Governance](docs/OPERATING_MODES.md).

> 28 advisory design modules (architecture, performance, design patterns, testability, package-specific source rules, etc.) are available in all modes and loaded on demand.

## 🏗️ Quick Install Supported IDE/Terminals

This project has been deeply optimized for the following environments (tools not listed are not necessarily unsupported — they just lack a quick installer; use ***Custom Installation*** instead. Per-tool skill directories are listed in the Manual Installation section below):

| AI Terminal | Support Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Antigravity** | ✅ Supported | Open Agent Skills standard; shares `.agents/skills/` with Codex in workspace mode |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Supported | Intelligent Skill intent recognition, supports complex multi-step automation |
| **Codex** | ✅ Supported | Supports `$skill` explicit invocation and implicit intent recognition |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Supported | Auto-discovers skill directories; supports `/skill-name` explicit invocation |
| **Kimi Code** | ✅ Supported | Native skill directory discovery; supports `/skill:unity-skills` explicit invocation |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ Supported | Native workspace and global skill directory discovery |

## 🏁 Quick Start

> **Overview**: Install Unity Plugin → Start UnitySkills Server → AI Uses Skills

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/installation-demo.gif" alt="一键安装演示" width="800">
</p>

### 1. Install Unity Plugin
Add via Unity Package Manager using Git URL:

**Stable Version (main)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity
```

**Beta Version (beta)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#beta
```

**Specific Version** (e.g., v1.6.0):
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#v1.6.0
```

> 📦 All version packages are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills/releases) page

### 2. Open the Panel & Start Server
In Unity, open menu: `Window > UnitySkills` (or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>). Use the server toggle switch in the top bar to start it; once started it auto-restarts across domain reloads.

> ⏳ `script_*`, `debug_force_recompile`, `debug_set_defines`, some asset reimports, and package changes may trigger compilation or Domain Reload. Temporary REST unavailability during that window is expected; wait a moment and retry.

### 3. One-Click AI Skills Configuration
1. Open `Window > UnitySkills` and go to the **AI Config** tab.
2. Select the corresponding terminal icon and click **"Install"** — the installer copies the `unity-skills~/` template from the package to the target location, no manual copying needed.

> 🔄 **Auto-sync on update**: after you upgrade the package, tools you already installed are refreshed to the new version automatically (nothing new is ever installed for you); turn it off in ⚙ Settings ▸ **AI Tools**.
>
> **Codex Note**: Antigravity and Codex share `.agents/skills/` in workspace mode — installing once makes the skill available to both; no `AGENTS.md` declaration needed for Codex.

📘 For complete installation and usage instructions, see: [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) | [安装指南](docs/SETUP_GUIDE_CN.md)

<summary><b>4. Manual Skills Installation (Optional)</b></summary>

If one-click installation is not supported or preferred, follow this **standard procedure** for manual deployment (applicable to all tools supporting Skills):

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method A
1. **Custom Installation**: In the installation interface, select the "Custom Path" option to install Skills to any directory you specify (e.g., `Assets/MyTools/AI`) for easier project management.

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method B
1. **Locate Skills Source Directory**: The `SkillsForUnity/unity-skills~/` directory in the UPM package is the distributable Skills template (root directory contains `SKILL.md`).
2. **Find the Tool's Skills Root Directory**: Different tools have different paths; refer to the tool's documentation first.
3. **Copy Completely**: Copy the entire contents of `unity-skills~/` to the tool's Skills root directory (rename to `unity-skills/`).
4. **Create agent_config.json**: Create an `agent_config.json` file in the `unity-skills/scripts/` directory:
   ```json
   {"agentId": "your-agent-name", "installedAt": "2026-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
   ```
   Replace `your-agent-name` with the name of your AI tool (e.g., `claude-code`, `antigravity`, `codex`, `cursor`).
5. **Directory Structure Requirements**: After copying, maintain the structure as follows (example):
   - `unity-skills/SKILL.md`
   - `unity-skills/skills/`
   - `unity-skills/references/`
   - `unity-skills/scripts/unity_skills.py`
   - `unity-skills/scripts/agent_config.json`
6. **Restart the Tool**: Let the tool reload the Skills list.
7. **Verify Loading**: Trigger the Skills list/command in the tool (or execute a simple skill call) to confirm availability.

#### 🔎 Common Tool Directory Reference
The following are verified default directories (if the tool has a custom path configured, use that instead):

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Antigravity: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` (global) or `.agents/skills/` (workspace)
- OpenAI Codex: `~/.agents/skills/` (global) or `.agents/skills/` (workspace, shared with Antigravity)
- Cursor: `~/.cursor/skills/` (global) or `.cursor/skills/` (workspace); also auto-discovers `.agents/skills/`
- OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/skills/` (global) or `.opencode/skills/` (workspace)
- Kimi Code: `~/.kimi-code/skills/` (global, or `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/`) or `.kimi-code/skills/` (project); also auto-discovers `.agents/skills/`

#### 🧩 Other Tools Supporting Skills
If you're using other tools that support Skills, install according to the Skills root directory specified in that tool's documentation. As long as the **standard installation specification** is met (root directory contains `SKILL.md` and maintains `skills/`, `references/`, and `scripts/` structure), it will be correctly recognized.
